Online-Banking allows you to download your data as csv. This tool provides you an Web-Interface to search for specific outgoings.

For example do you would like to know how much you have paid in the last month at <code>Starbucks</code>?

Upload your banking data as CSV (*You can download the csv file in your online banking application*, *Tested with Sparkasse*) 
Type in a search key like <code>starbucks</code>

Choose a range or just say *February*

The total amount you have paid at starbucks in this range will appear on the screen.

**Work in Progress**
